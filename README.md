## Features with under 2 engagement interactactions
Since TikTok analytics only allows access to the past 60 days of data, there was a limited amount of data to analyze during this period.

## Notes
I was curious about the large amount of views the client recieved on 11/11 and 11/12 and after speaking with the client, turns out they decided to experiment with something new and dressed up in a costume for a holiday video. 

# Insights
#### Summary of key findings:
* In the last 60 days there was a total of 887 video views
* With A 28% video view rate within the 60 day time frame
* Huge increase in engagement on 11/11/22 and 11/12/22
* Profile views, shares and comments have little to no engagement


# Recommendations
##### To increase TikTok video views and drive in traffic:
* Seek potential collaboration opportunities from channels that can drive traffic to videos
* Posting videos of different kinds with different sounds to gauge what viewers like most
* Use popular hashtags on video postings
* Make the thumbnail photos aesthetically appealing to entice viewers to click on videos
